# primo-explore-custom-no-results
Add custom text and an option to expand results to PCI when no records retrieved.

The OTB page in the Primo NUI for a no results search looks like this:

![No results OTB](/primo-explore-custom-no-results/no_results_otb.png?raw=true "No results OTB")

The custom js in this package adds an option to expand results to PCI records that you don't have full-text.  It also allows you to adjust the text and other links you provide when a user isn't successful in their search.

Here's how we've customized at St. Olaf College:

![No results customized](/primo-explore-custom-no-results/no_results_custom.png?raw=true "No results customized")
